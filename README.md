```

About the game content
```

You may encounter platforms that you have to jump, pick ups to collect, 
and a secret related to a jump platform.
In this game there are two levels, you can access the second level crossing the first finish line.

If you try to commit suicide as the soccer ball jumping into the abyss, you will restart the level instead. 
It is and enless nightmare for the ball, eternaly doomed to live :D
